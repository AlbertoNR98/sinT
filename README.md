sinT is a digital, polyphonic, multi-platform synthesizer. Compatible with GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac, it can be run as an independent program (standard standalone and kiosk mode) and in VST3 plugin format on x64 and ARM systems.

## Technical specifications
 - 16-voice polyphony (expandable via source code according to host system characteristics).
 - Intuitive user interface design aimed at facilitating integration of sinT into systems with diverse features, such as small-sized touchscreens.
 - Oscillators:
    - Two independent oscillators with bypass control.
    - Four different waveforms:
        - Sine.
        - Sawtooth.
        - Square.
        - Triangle.
    - Gain and pitch controls.
    - One FM operator per oscillator -> FM synthesis.
 - ADSR envelopes to control waveform amplitude and filter frequency action.
 - State variable filter with three different modes:
    - Low-pass.
    - Band-pass.
    - High-pass.
 - Low-frequency oscillator (LFO) to modulate filter cutoff frequency.
 - FX processor:
    - Soft Clipping Distortion.
    - Delay.
    - Chorus.
    - Reverb.
 - Dual-channel output waveform visualizer.
 - Ability to save and load user and factory presets.
